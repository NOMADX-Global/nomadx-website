                    <p>
                        The world is changing faster than ever, but our education system is stuck in the past. Long, lecture-based 
                        university programs weren't designed for an era where information is instant and AI can answer any question. 
                        They teach you what to think, not how to adapt, create, and persevere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NOMAD COACH is our response. We're building a new learning model focused on what truly matters in the 21st century.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Our Philosophy: Human Strengths, Amplified by AI</h4>
                    <p>
                        In an era of artificial intelligence, our greatest strengths are not in rote memorization or repetitive tasks. 
                        They lie in what makes us uniquely human. At NOMAD COACH, we focus on developing two core pillars:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ol class="numbered-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Analog Thinking + Execution with Perseverance:</strong> This is our foundation. We cultivate your 
                            ability to think creatively, connect disparate ideas, and see the big picture (Analog Thinking). Then, we 
                            build the grit, resilience, and practical skills to turn those ideas into reality (Execution with Perseverance).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>AI Literacy and Applied Usage:</strong> We don't ignore technology; we embrace it as a powerful tool. 
                            To truly amplify your human abilities, we believe essential AI literacy and its practical, applied usage are 
                            non-negotiable. You'll learn how to leverage AI to work smarter, create faster, and solve bigger problems.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h4>The Method: Intensive, Project-Based Learning</h4>
                    <p>
                        Forget endless semesters and theoretical exams. Our model is built on short, intensive, project-based learning. 
                        You learn by doing, tackling real-world challenges in a compressed, high-energy timeframe. This isn't about 
                        passive listening; it's about active creation, rapid iteration, and building a portfolio of tangible results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach is proven to be more effective and efficient than long, traditional university programs, equipping 
                        you with relevant skills you can apply immediately.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>A New Kind of Classroom</h4>
                    <p>
                        This isn't your typical school. Our learning formats are as dynamic and creative as the skills you'll acquire. 
                        Expect to be challenged and inspired through formats like:
                    </p>
